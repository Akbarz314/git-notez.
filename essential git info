##** Setting up a Git Respositorey

1. Importing

- In a terminal type the following: $ cd test (cd = change directory). Use the git init commnand by typing $ git init. 
1. To start tracking these repositories perform an initial comment by typing the following: git add *.c, git add LISCENCE, git commit -m “any message here”.

   ###cLONING
   
   You can also create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command with a repository’s URL:
  1. git clone https://github.com/test
  -To clone a repository into a directory with another name of your choosing, use the following command format:
  1. git clone https://github.com/test mydirectory
  
  ###**CLONED REPOSITORIES**
  1. As mentioned earlier, for cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.
  
  
 SEEING YOUR REMOTES:
 1. By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
 
 - By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
